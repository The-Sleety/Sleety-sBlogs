## SleetyBlogs

this is a website that i started making a while ago. I made the site windows xp styled, because i like windows xp and the nostalgia from that time era.
I recently added a new home page with some applications that redirect you to websites or links of mine.
I made this website because i like writing "logs" about my games in my notebook and i want to share it with y'all.

## How to use it

If you want to use my site as a base of yours or directly take the whole site and put, just give me credits about the website first. 
I spent a lot  of time making this so thanks already.
