                <h3>Hello and welcome to another devlog of the WebRPG;</h3>

                <p style="font-size: large;"> > Today im gonna summarize the devlogs between 2 - 7. I'm doing this because devlogs between 2 and 7 is basicly same things again and again. Anyways,</p>
                <p style="font-size: large;"> > Devlog 2: I drew some enemy sprites (eye, slime, fireball, skeleton, bat, etc.)</p>
                <p style="font-size: large;"> > Devlog 3: Lost to time i think. (not really)</p>
                <p style="font-size: large;"> > Devlog 4: I started the game in godot engine with top down controller, told that i will make the player attack like in the original legend of the zelda game, and gave some update about things i added to website and removed later. Drew the top down island for the first time and promoted my <a href="https://discord.gg/ZAhjZnCUbd" style="color: 	#5865F2;">discord server</a>.</p>
                <p style="font-size: large;"> > Devlog 5: I told that, we were still waiting principals permission to use the coding room while we dont have a coding teacher. Drew another map for the game and told about the ANKARA - ESKİŞEHİR trip school plans.</p>
                <p style="font-size: large;"> > Devlog 6: In this devlog i wrote that i started player sprites with a template (still topdown) and about the tilesets template (i gave every tile a number, for example grass tiles = 1, water tiles = 2), and talked about how i'm gonna port this game to nintendo ds or 3ds (spoiler alert! i probably won't). I told that how the school computers are so slow that they can't even run godot 4 and because of that we use godot 3.5.2.</p>
                <p style="font-size: large;"> > Devlog 7: I wrote about how we probably are gonna change engines from godot to unity because some random guy on internet said godot was only for hobbists.</p>
                <p style="font-size: large;"> > MiniLog 1: I wrote about how i made a topdown melee combat in unity. And said that i'm going to Ankara at 18th of october. And lastly gave a to-do list for the game.  (probably a useless list.)And talked about the abilities that players gonna have (Dashing, shadow, invisiblity)</p>

                  <p style="font-size: large;"> > MiniLog 2: I talked about how i couldn't convinced them and how we're gonna use zelda 1's combat system.</p>
