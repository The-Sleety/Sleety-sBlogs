                <h3>Hello and welcome to the 2nd devlog of the WebRPG;</h3>
                  <p style="font-size: medium;">It's 9.55 am, we're in the music lesson right now. It's so boring. Anyway, welcome to another devlog of the WebRPG, soo lets start. Ok now, still the development hasn't started yet. Beacouse 1stof all there is no coding teacher, 2nd the clubs havent revealed and started, and i don't know the people. Only ones that i know that are coming 100% are <a style="color: goldenrod;">Orexw</a> and <a style="color: goldenrod;">me</a></p>
                  <p style="font-size: medium;"> But i have some ideas for it. 1st, scrap the idea for the point and click movement, i want to have WASD/arrow buttons movement and melee combat, beacouse it will be better for most of the people. Because i want the story to be deep, and not like "Lucas's Quest". We're gonna use godot 3/4 this time, last time we used a new engine the game was a complete crap. We hope it would be better. Anyway, you may ask "Why not unity or unreal engine they both are better than godot" it's because unity released an pricing for their engine this week, and we want to be able to make the game run on web. Godot is open source because of that we can always ad new things (but we probably won't).</p>
                  <p style="font-size: medium;"> Ok so we get the question out of the way, here is the list of the items i will add;</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Swords</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Axes</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Armors</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Stick?</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Keys</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Something like triforce</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p style="font-size: medium;">And meybe more. You are probably wondering what does the stick does, stick will teleport the enemy to the final boss place. you'll need to fight everything there.</p>
                  <h4>10.39 AM</h4>
                  <p style="font-size: medium;"> Ok so, i think this is one of the longest devlogs. So lets get over the game and what we're going to do.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Game Style: Fantasy, 2D, RPG</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Movement: WASD/Arrows</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Combat: Melee</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Engine: Godot 3/4</li>
                    <li style="font-size: large;">Story: Deepsness   Fun<--------------|--->Batman Deep </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p style="font-size: medium;">Ok so i did the all the things, i don't want to use ready made sprites, i might use templates or get insporation from the other assets. For the story, i don't want main character to be a human, i don't want world to be a human wold. But the character will be similar to humans, it would be like link from zelda. I don't think i will write more today so have a great day, good bye.</p>
