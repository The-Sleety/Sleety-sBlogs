                <h3>WebRPG please give me name ideas</h3>
                     <p style="font-size: medium;">Hello welcome to the first devlog of this game, anyway lets start;</p>
                     <p style="font-size: medium;">Probably for kent fest. Will be made in godot or pure html, js, css with phaser.js . If i make in godot it will be pretty easy, but if i make in it's going to be prety hard, B U U U U T i already have a little demo in may hand. In godot, i may be able to add multiplayer to it, but it can be very hard, bc it will be played in web. Why godot, why not unreal or unity. 1st unity just released a price chart. 2nd unreal is hard and i need to make it be able to play in web. Why in web and not a standlone app. Because i want the game to be easly accsesable everywhere. </p> 
                     <p style="font-size: medium;">  Ok now i should talk about the mechanics, look and feel. Game will controlled as point and click. You could control with keyboard. You will be able to click to a enemy and fight it, i will try to start to make it soon as possible√ß Art style will be fantasy. The Story will be deep. This time want to give the game a good name. Movement will be 8 diractional. With this game i want touse git, continue it at home and make devlogs to make people aware of my self and the game. I really want to make this game with my team. Ok so this was the devlog 0, i may start to make videos but i really dont know any way good bye.</p>
